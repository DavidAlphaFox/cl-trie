[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MatthewRock/cl-trie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MatthewRock/cl-trie)

Overview
--------

cl-trie is a package that contains an implementation of a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure. It utilizes CLOS. By default the trie is indexed by strings, but can be extended to other data types by the means of implementing methods.

License
--------

cl-trie is licensed with MIT license, which means that you can do pretty much everything with it.


Compatibility
--------

I am trying to build the library on as many compilers that I can. I have encountered some problems with UIOP on CLISP; therefore, CLISP is not supported.

Example
--------

cl-trie is a work in progress and therefore currently not ready for use. For this reason I am not providing any examples; when the working version is released, this section will be updated.

Contact
--------

Feel free to contact me by my e-mail (which can be found in cl-trie.asd), or by creating an issue.
